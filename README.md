# car-rental-management-system

I'm aware of all the unused css files. I'll get rid of them when I have the time

This is a web-based car rental system developed as part of a university project. The system allows users to search for available cars, make reservations, and manage their bookings. It was developed using HTML, Bootstrap, PHP, and MySQL.

Features:

    User authentication: users can create an account and log in to the system
    Car search: users can search for available cars based on cars, date, and time
    Reservation management: users can reserve a car, modify or cancel their bookings, and view their rental history
    Admin panel: an admin can ~~manage the car fleet,~~ view reservations, and add or remove users from the system

Technologies used:

    HTML and Bootstrap for the frontend design
    PHP for server-side scripting
    MySQL for the database management
